Since the user didn't provide specific details, I'll have to come up with a plausible example. Let's pick a common name like John Doe. Age should be a positive integer, maybe 30 years old. Occupation is software engineer.\n\nWait, the parameters for structured_output have name, age (required), and occupation (optional). So I'll set name to \"John Doe\", age to 30, occupation to \"Software Engineer\". Let me double-check the schema: age must be at least 1, which 30 is. All required fields are present. Looks good.
